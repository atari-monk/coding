[My](https://github.com/atari-monk) reflections on what I do.

## 2025-02-25, Project Shift Mindset

I no longer want to engage in projects the way I used to. There will be no goal to "finish" the project. It will always be done in self-contained sessions. There’s no need to complete the project. It will either grow from this or not. I don't care.

Exactly, I want to mimic the way a plant grows. Each session will just make it grow in some way. Quality code only. Clever sessions with a plan, start, and finish. When the session is done, the project should always be in a good state, just like a growing plant.

It's like cultivating a garden: you nurture it, prune it when necessary, and let it grow naturally.

If a session doesn’t work, I’ll just remove the changes—like a plant shedding a leaf that didn’t serve it well. No attachment to bad growth, just clean, intentional progress. Each session is self-contained, and if it doesn’t improve things, it doesn’t stay. This keeps everything in a constantly healthy state.

The plan will contain limits. This also applies to any past projects I revisit. This is the result of a project I tried to finish in the past that consumed all my time and burned me out. It wasn’t fun.

Old projects are up for debate. I may just take parts of them, rewrite them in a new repo, and bring them back—or do it in place. The key is, even refactoring should be seen as growth. It was smaller in its previous state, now it’s bigger, better, and still a healthy plant. Refactoring isn’t just about "fixing"—it’s about evolving the project, like a plant getting stronger and more refined over time.

No pressure, no obligations—just organic growth.

I will start tomorrow with just reading and small refactoring of the data library in a project. It’s like looking at a plant and watering it a bit. No radical changes.

It’s time to add reflection to the process. Evaluate each session and project.

Have fun!
