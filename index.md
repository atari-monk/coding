[My](https://github.com/atari-monk) reflections on what i do.

## 2025-02-25, Project Shift Mindset

No longer i want to engage in projects in a way i was. There will be no goal to complete project. It will be always done in self containt sessions. No need to continue project. It will either grow form this or not. I dont care.

Yeah exatly that i want to mimic the way plant is growing. Session will just make it grow in some way. Quality code only. Cleaver session with plan, start and fisnish. On finish project should be always fine. Just like growing plant.

It's like cultivating a garden: you nurture it, prune it when necessary, and let it grow naturally.

If session donst work i will just remove changes.
Like a plant dropping a leaf that didn’t serve it well. No attachment to bad growth, just clean, intentional progress. Each session is self-contained, and if it doesn’t improve things, it doesn’t stay. That keeps everything in a constantly healthy state.

Plan will contain limits. Also this applies to any past projects i will revisit. This is a consequence of a project that i tried to finish and it took all my time and just burned me. Not fun.

Old project are up to debate. I may just take some part, rewrite it in new repo, bring it back. Or do it in place. Key is, even refactor should be seen as growth of a plant. It was smaller in prevois state now its bigger better and still healty plant. Refactoring isn’t just about "fixing" but about evolving the project, like a plant getting stronger and more refined over time.

No pressure, no obligations—just organic growth.

Will start tomorrow. With just reading and small refactoring of data library in a project. So it's like looking at plant and watering it a bit. No radical stuff.

It is about time to add reflection to doing stuff. 
Evaluate each session and project.

Have fun!
